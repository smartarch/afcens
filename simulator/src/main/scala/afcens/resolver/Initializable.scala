    *      instance are registered
    * <li> [[InitStages.VarsCreation]]: solver variables are generated
    * <li> [[InitStages.RulesCreation]]: concrete rules and constraints are posted
    * </ul>
    *
    * The base implementation handles the `ConfigPropagation` stage.
    *
    * @param stage Current initialization phase
    * @param config Policy configuration object being propagated
