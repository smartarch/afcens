/** Integer constraint type.
  *
  * Represents a value that can be used as an integer in the solver. This means that
  * constraints can be generated based on its value. Basic arithmetic operators are
  * overloaded, so it is possible to use `Integer` in a way similar to the native `Int`
  * type.
  *
  * Note that equality of `Integer`s must be tested with `===`, as it is impossible to
  * properly overload the built-in `==` operator.
